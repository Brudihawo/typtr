# A WIP typing trainer with some extended analysis features

## Goals
- [ ] Basic working TUI

- [ ] Detect common letter combination errors / speed deficits
- [ ] Adaptive word frequencies
- [ ] Adapt word count to speed deficits and error types
- [ ] Configure scales for error adaption
- [ ] Custom Word list
- [ ] Raw output for analysis
- [ ] Some basic plotting scripts / jupyter notebooks in python

Got the current wordlist from [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/deekayen/4148741/raw/98d35708fa344717d8eee15d11987de6c8e26d7d/1-1000.txt)
